    - title: RUBUS – text message support for Nextbus
      timeline: Spring 2010 – Current
      link: http://eden.rutgers.edu/~vverna/nextbus
      text: This project is, by far, the project I’m most proud of working on. Rutgers has a system in place called [Nextbus](http://nextbus.com) which allows us to get live bus times online from GPSes that are installed on campus buses. I implemented a simple text message interface into the Nextbus API inspired by [Shuttleboy](http://shuttleboy.cs50.net). I used [Textmarks](http://textmarks.com) to call my web service on receipt of a text message. At the peak of its use (a couple of years ago, before smartphones really took off), RUBUS received around ~10,000 requests every week. The service has been running on its own for two years, and I’ve enjoyed [listening to feedback and acting on it](https://www.facebook.com/events/387829941112/).
