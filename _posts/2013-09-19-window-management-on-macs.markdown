title: "Keyboard Focused Development Workflow on Macs"

Having used Linux almost exclusively for the last four years, I miss efficient window management on Macs. Coming from the [awesome window manager](http://awesome.naquadah.org/), I find that OS X does not have good support for a two monitor multiple workspace workflow out of the box. After tinkering with third party software, I believe I've found a good solution for most of my complaints, and have a workflow that I feel productive with. In my experience, this works best with multiple monitors, a standard keyboard (think Dell not Apple), and a three button mouse (I'm not a fan of touchpads or Apple mice).

### Setting up Multiple Desktops

I really like the use of multiple desktops in my workflow. I usually set up four desktops. I keep [Spotify](http://spotify.com) open on the very last one. The middle ones are my "work" desktops that I use for terminals, browsers, IDEs, and documentation. The first one is usually a "distraction workspace" that will have my email, and [Adium](http://adium.com) open. This helps me keep my windows organized, and keep focus when I need to.

In order to set this up, I add additional desktops (up to 4). The easiest way to do this is to open up `Mission Control` (usually Control-Up), hover over the Desktops, and click the Plus button on the top right.

Once this is done, I would recommend setting up easy keybindings to switch between desktops. To do this, you go to `System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control`. Then you can set up keybindings for `Move left a space`, ... `Switch to Desktop 1-4`. I use `Ctrl-Alt-Left/Right` to move between desktops, and use `Command-1/2/3/4` to jump to a desktop.
